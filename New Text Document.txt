I have the following project: 
1. Asp.Net webapi 9.0
2. Uses FastEndPoint with command handlers
3. Implements function for IdentityUser using EFCore
4. Uses Dapper for other database functionalities.
5. Uses Firebird Sql as backend database.
6. Uses vertical slice architecture.
7. Generate code inline from now on.

I have a library project ESLAdmin.Infrastructure, with a Persistence directory. Where should I store the IdentityErrorHandler file
